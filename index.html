              <h2>01. About Me</h2>
              <p>Hello There ! My name is William and I enjoy improving things using AI.</p>
              <p>My interest for this matter started 
                when I was a child and I was playing video games. I was always fascinated by the dialogues between the characters and the player. 
                I was always wondering how we could improve them. I thought that coding every dialogue line would be simple, but I realized that it would take an incredible amount of time for each NPC. 
                Then I learned about AI and suddenly, everything seemed possible. Not only for videogames, but also for almost everything else. </p> 
                <p>
                 I aim to become a Machine Learning engineer or a Deep learning engineer. My goal is to work in a big company to be able to work on big scale projects that will be directly used by people.
                  But for now I am looking for 6-12 months internship.</p>
